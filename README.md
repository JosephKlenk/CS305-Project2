# CS305-Project2

  For all required security measures of their web application, Artemis Financial, a consulting firm that develops customized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance, turned to us. Surely, the company needed to modernize operations in order to have a satisfactory level of performance with a verification system through checksum for their file sharing process. A large number of different security vulnerabilities were easily spotted by myself as their developer, through dependency checks that formed part of the entire vulnerability assessment, upon which I'd highlighted issues concerning critical dependencies like spring-boot-starter-data-rest, jackson-databind, and much more. The above process showed exactly why one needs to practice secure coding, because vulnerabilities in financial software lead to data breach and losses. With the SHA-256 algorithm and good configuration for SSL/TLS, the security posture of the company was enhanced tremendously, thus securing the sensitive financial data of its corporate clients as well as its own reputation. The first challenge was to mitigate these vulnerabilities raised by the dependency check, amongst which were spring-beans and tomcat-embed-core; it offered a stimulating experience in particularly assessing vulnerabilities while trying to mitigate their cause.

  The security implementation involved various layers. They involved the switching from HTTP to HTTPS, implementing SHA-256 checksums on data for verification, generating self-signed certificates with Java Keytool, and ensuring proper key storage in the application's resources. For application security and working capability verification after refactoring, tests conducted were thorough, including relying on OWASP's dependency-check-maven plugin for dependency checks, manual code reviews, and checksum functionality verification, using specific test data showing my name. For future vulnerability assessments, I would employ similar methodologies of using dependency checks and the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram to systematically identify and address security concerns. The manual code review process and dependency scanning proved to be invaluable tools that I will certainly utilize in upcoming projects. Essential tools and practices employed in this project are: Spring Boot for the development of secure web applications; Maven for dependency management; Java Keytool for the proper handling of certificates; secure coding practices such as input validation and proper error handling. For future employers, the project demonstrates hands-on skills in implementing cryptographic algorithms (SHA-256), SNS management, certificates, running vulnerability assessments, and developing secure REST endpoints. The successful completion of the project proved my ability to analyze security requirements, implement appropriate security controls, and apply secure coding techniques on financial data, important skills in today's world of cybersecurity-oriented software development.
